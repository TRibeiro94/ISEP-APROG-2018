Mooshak is a system for managing programming contests on the Web. Mooshak's basic features include automatic judging of submitted programs, answering to clarification questions about problem descriptions, reevaluation of programs, tracking printouts, among many others.

Mooshak supports different kinds of contest, specially those based on ICPC rules. It has also support for IOI and "shortest program" contests, and can be easily extended for new types of contests.

The system was originally intended for contests, but it is increasingly being used in programming courses: to give instant feedback on practical classes, to receive and validate assignments submissions, to pre-evaluate and mark assignments, etc.

Mooshak is an Open Source Software distributed under Artistic License.
